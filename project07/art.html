                        <p>When I moved in for my second year of college, my mom gave me a cookbook filled with printed recipes that she knew I would miss. I want to honor this gesture and her cooking by creating a cookbook filled with illustrations of all of my favorite foods that she makes for me. Though I only have a few illustrations, I plan to work on this as a side project until I have nearly a hundred recipes showcased.</p>
