                        <p>This is a personal endeavor that I have been working on this summer. I was looking for posters for my college apartment that felt unique and personal to me and I didn't feel that any I could purchase or print out resonated with me in the way that I wanted. I was looking through some photos I had taken over the summer when I was inspired to create my own posters. I started collecting photos (of and by me) that I liked, edited them, and found overlays on Pinterest that matched the sort of "old film camera" vibe I was looking for. I then came up with the idea of having each poster represent something I "value" in life. When I went to add the value to each poster, I didn't feel like any of the fonts I could find matched what I was looking for in terms of a sort of whimsical, beachy, bold font, so I went into Illustrator and created a new font completely freehand using the curved line tool and edited the letters as needed to create new words. Finally, I used the brush tool to add little drawings and outlines onto the photos for a silly, more personal touch and to make the images fit their chosen word better. Shown below are some of my favorites:</p>

                        <p>In April 2024, I started a new position as the Apparel Chair for Syracuse University DanceWorks, a student-run dance organization on campus. My first project was to ideate, design, edit, and polish graphics for a hoodie and a tank-top. I was given about two weeks to get this done and this is what I created. Here are the final designs and mock-ups.</p>

                <h2>IMPASSE MAGAZINE APP PROJECT</h2>
                <div class="flexproject">
                    <div class = "explainer">
                        <h3>Design Strategy:</h3>
                        <p>The concept behind this design was a very simple and clean look for the magazine. I wanted it to be very intuitive and easy to use, using very few buttons and clear symbols. Though I spent a lot of time experimenting with different transitions and other functions, I wanted to make sure that the animations didn’t cloud the vision or seem unnecessary. The users of this app would be primarily women and probably a younger demographic, so I wanted it to use functions and symbols that are common in similar news apps that already exist for this demographic. </p>
                        <h3>Typefaces:</h3>
                        <p>I used the same typefaces as in the magazine for my app. The title font, STIXGeneral, is sort of a timeless, fancy feeling font that captures the essence of the magazine while the other major font, DINCondensed, is more of a simple, futuristic feeling sans-serif font that works better for smaller text and also brings a more modern feel to some aspects of the app. I did find, however, that the original body font for the story didn’t translate as well for the app version, so I used STIXGeneral again for that. </p>
                        <h3>Interactions:</h3>
                        <p>I ended up using a lot of different interactive elements in my UI design. I started by just adding in page transitions through the buttons, and specifically making them slide transitions for more of a natural flow between pages. Because of this, I also ended up adding a few extra pages so that more of the buttons could be functional, such as the “saved articles”  page, the “comments” page, and the “log out” page. Where I got the most creative, however, was with the animations. The most obvious example of this is the splash page, which I spent a lot of time on and used 5 pages for. I really liked the way this turned out and I feel that it made my app feel a little more official and realistic. I also used animation in the article to have the pull quote expand when scrolling, as well as to have the infographic bars pop out only when scrolling. I’m not sure how functional this would be in a real app because it requires the cursor to hover over the image, which you don’t have in an app, but for the purpose of this project, I think it looks nice. I also made the “save” button functional and the number increases when you press it as well. Finally, in terms of animated interactions, some of the text and symbols, such as “back to top,” the profile circle, the “log in” button, and “back to articles” get larger and/or change color when they are hovered over. Overall, I felt that these little additions made the design a lot more interesting and interactive.</p>
                        <h3>Medium>:</h3>
                        <p>I think the primary challenge in converting my magazine design to mobile was just rearranging all of the elements because I really liked the way I organized everything in the magazine and some elements worked to serve a specific design purpose in the magazine that couldn’t be translated well in the mobile version. It was hard to keep the same feel when the story and all of the elements had to fit into a small, vertical box instead, but I feel like I did a pretty good job of matching the design to the magazine using colors and fonts.</p>
                        <h3>Growth:</h3>
                        <p>I had never used XD or done any sort of UI design prior to this project, and because this is something that I am interested in pursuing as a career, I had a lot of fun with the whole project and just exploring the capabilities of XD. Throughout this course, I got to experiment with a lot of different programs that I had never used before and I really enjoyed coming up with concepts for each project and then bringing them to life in different ways.</p>

                <h2 id="impasse">IMPASSE MAGAZINE PROJECT</h2>
                <div class="flexproject">
                    <div class = "explainer">
                        <h3>Design Strategy:</h3>
                        <p>I have always been interested in the issue of fast fashion and I thought that it would be an interesting way to combine the two types of magazines that I interact with the most (fashion + politics). The magazine name “Impasse” basically means a standstill, which I feel is a great description of the state of politics at the moment. Overall, I wanted the magazine to feel elegant and have a clear aesthetic, as a fashion magazine would, while still being informational and interesting. It is meant as a women’s politics magazine, which is emphasized by the subtitle “politics for chicks.”</p>
                        <h3>Typefaces:</h3>
                        <p>I chose two primary fonts for my titles and headings: DIN Condensed Bold and STIXGeneral Bold. I chose STIXGeneral because it has a more elegant feel that is more generally associated with the fashion industry and fashion magazines. I chose DIN Condensed because it has a modern feel that brings in a more serious tone to associate with the political aspect of the magazine. Paired together, I feel that they capture the essence of the magazine, which is a serious political magazine that still shares the elegance and beauty of common women’s interest magazines. </p>
                        <h3>Margins:</h3>
                        <p>For my main body spread, I used a grid with 3 columns and I didn’t really use rows. Instead, I let the image of the hanger dictate where the text falls on the page using the text warping feature. </p>
                        <h3>Visuals:</h3>
                        <p>I changed my cover image a few times, but I ultimately decided on a photo of a woman reading a magazine that had a vintage feel. I covered the magazine with my own titles to show the irony of a woman wearing pre-fast-fashion era clothing reading a magazine about SHEIN. I chose the photo for my opening spread because I liked the colors a lot and I felt that the clothing rack with multiple of the same item is a great example of the mass production that happens in the fast fashion industry. For my main body spread, I chose a simple image of a hanger because I felt that it fit the theme and worked well with the text. Finally, for my advertisement, I chose a simple image of a reusable bag that relates to the environmental focus of the article inside. </p>
                        <h3>Growth:</h3>
                        <p>Through this project, I learned a lot about consistency in aesthetic. This is the first project we have really done that involved multiple pages and though I liked my intial cover, once I started working on the rest of the magazine, it didn’t fit the aesthetic feel very well, so I had to start from scratch and create a cover that was more consistent with the other pages. This was a good opportunity to learn about adapting to the situation and problem solving.</p>

                <h2>SURF ROCK FESTIVAL POSTER PROJECT</h2>
                <div class="flexproject">
                    <div class = "explainer">
                        <h3>Design Strategy:</h3>
                        <p>When I started thinking about poster ideas, I knew I wanted to do something related to my home state of California. I am a huge music person and when I started thinking about how I could play on the shape of different instruments, the pointy parts of the electric guitar came to mind as waves. I thought that would be a perfect visual concept for a surf rock concert. I initially tried creating the concept in Photoshop with stock images of an electric guitar and waves, but it didn’t have the fun, vibrant vibe of a beachside concert that I was going far, so I decided to move to Illustrator to create the visual imagery myself.</p>
                        <h3>Audience:</h3>
                        <p>My poster is meant to feel beachy and somewhat laid-back, while also looking fun, exciting, and inviting. I think the fun aspect is primarily exhibited through the exaggerated beachy colors and the illustrated visuals that provide a more fantastical, vibrant mood. The laid-back aspect comes through more through the tagline and the overall simplicity of the poster. </p>
                        <h3>Visuals:</h3>
                        <p>The primary “image” used in my poster is the guitar I created in Illustrator. The guitar itself is sort of a play on words because the event is a surf rock concert and the guitar combines the two elements: “surf” with the waves and “rock” with the guitar. I intentionally used only two very bright complementary colors that I associate with the beach to keep it simple yet vibrant. I also used gridlines to align the edges of the tagline with the edges of the guitar and I used the gestalt principles in the tagline because the words form the shape of a wave and communicate that without the need for an outline of the shape. </p>
                        <h3>Growth:</h3>
                        <p>I really liked learning about the Gestalt principle and I had fun using it for my tagline. When I was working on the tagline, I wasn’t entirely sure how to execute it, so I just spent some time on Illustrator experimenting with different ideas. I ended up converting the text into outlines and adjusting each point into the shape I wanted. I later learned that there is an easier way, but I still enjoyed exploring the features in Illustrator and testing out different ideas.</p>

                        <p>In January 2024, I started a position on the graphics team for University Girl Magazine, a student-run fashion and culture magazine at Syracuse University. My first project with UGirl was a spread about beauty standards and how we often inherit them from our mothers. When I started my first draft, all I had to go off of was the title of the story. As you can see through my process, I had to adapt constantly to fit the feel of the story, as well as the requests of the graphics editors. Ultimately, the spread was changed to one page with no photos at the last minute, so I had to cut parts of my original final draft, resulting in the one page spread at the bottom right.</p>
