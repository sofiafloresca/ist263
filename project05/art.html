                <h2>MOM'S COOKBOOK</h2>
                <p>When I moved in for my second year of college, my mom gave me a cookbook filled with printed recipes that she knew I would miss. I want to honor this gesture and her cooking by creating a cookbook filled with illustrations of all of my favorite foods that she makes for me. Though I only have a few illustrations, I plan to work on this as a side project until I have nearly a hundred recipes showcased.</p>
                <p>Done in watercolor.</p>

                <h2>HOME SWEET...HOME?</h2>
                <p>This is a painting/drawing I did of my childhood home, prior to its repainting while I was gone. You can sort of guess how I felt about my parents changing things while I was away…</p>

                <p>I  love watercolor and I often paint when I am bored, tired, emotional, or inspired. Here are a couple extra paintings I’ve done that I love.</p>
