<body>
    Hi! My name is Sofia Floresca. 
    I am from San Mateo, California and I am an honors student at Syracuse University pursuing a dual-degree in Graphic Design and Information Management & Technology. While I am not entirely sure what I would like to do with this degree after I graduate, I am currently most interested in the UX/UI Design and Motion Design fields. I hope to pursue a career that falls at the intersection of my interests in design and technology. 
    Outside of class, I am the Apparel Chair for Syracuse Danceworks, the Design Director for University Girl Magazine, and a member of the Sigma Delta Tau Sorority. I am entering my third semester here at Syracuse and I am proud to say that I have made the Deanâ€™s List the past two semesters and am both a Newhouse Leadership Scholar and an Invest In Success Scholar.
    I am a creative person who loves to paint, draw, dance, and create. As a California girl, I feel a special connection to the ocean and love the beach, but I am also a lover of mountains and snow and am an avid skier. I am a binge-watcher, a foodie, and a self-proclaimed fashionista on a limited budget.
