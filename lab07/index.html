    <h1>Sofia Floresca's Biography</h1>
    <img src="../images/image-and-text.jpg" alt="Sofia Floresca Syracuse Student">
    <p>
        Hi! My name is Sofia Floresca. I am from San Mateo, California and I am an honors student at Syracuse University pursuing a dual-degree in <strong>Graphic Design</strong> and <strong>Information Management & Technology</strong>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        While I am not entirely sure what I would like to do with this degree after I graduate, I am currently most interested in the <strong>UX/UI Design</strong> and <strong>Motion Design</strong> fields. I hope to pursue a career that falls at the intersection of my interests in design and technology. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I am entering my third semester here at Syracuse and I am proud to say that I have made the Deanâ€™s List the past two semesters and am both a Newhouse Leadership Scholar and an Invest In Success Scholar.

    <h2>Personal Info</h2>
    <p>
        I am a creative person who loves to paint, draw, dance, and create. As a California girl, I feel a special connection to the ocean and love the beach, but I am also a lover of mountains and snow and am an avid skier. I am a binge-watcher, a foodie, and a self-proclaimed fashionista on a limited budget.
